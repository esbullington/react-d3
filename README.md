## react-d3
Modular ReactJS charts made using d3 chart utilities. Work on project documentation has started [here](https://github.com/esbullington/react-d3/wiki). A few examples of the available charts can be seen below, the others can be [viewed here](http://esbullington.github.io/react-d3-website), side-by-side with the React code that generates the charts.

**Caution:**  alpha state software. Chart APIs will change. Breaking changes will occur at each minor (0.x) release, until we reach version 1.0.  At that point, we'll closely follow the [semver](http://semver.org/) specification.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/esbullington/react-d3.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/esbullington/react-d3)

### Version
[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/react-d3.png)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-d3)

### Basic usage

First, install via `npm`:

`npm install react-d3`

Then, import into your ReactJS project:

`var rd3 = require('react-d3');`

The charts are then available under the `rd3` namespace, which you can then use as shown on the [demonstration page](http://esbullington.github.io/react-d3-website/):

If you don't wish to pull in all the charts, you can also require single chart:

`var BarChart = require('react-d3/barchart').BarChart;`

### Available Charts

```
var BarChart = rd3.BarChart;
var LineChart = rd3.LineChart;
var PieChart = rd3.PieChart;
var AreaChart = rd3.AreaChart;
var Treemap = rd3.Treemap;
var ScatterChart = rd3.ScatterChart;
```

For usage, please see [here](http://esbullington.github.io/react-d3-website).  API documentation is also coming online over the coming days.

### JSFiddle
There's a development build available for experimentation on JSFiddle: [http://jsfiddle.net/esbullington/jp9dkh1g/](https://cdn.rawgit.com/esbullington/react-d3/dc92f90910c0b2878d1031428604e2f50ef7bfdd/dist/public/js/react-d3.min.js)

Please note that this build should probably not be used in production, since it bundles all of react-d3's dependencies in a single bundle (this is also the cause of the "Cannot read property 'firstChild' of undefined" error message on the JS console, which occurs when there are two React libraries in the same namespace).

All the react-d3 charts are available in this JSFiddle fork under the global `rd3` namespace.

### Background
Although there have been [several](http://nicolashery.com/integrating-d3js-visualizations-in-a-react-app/) [different](http://bl.ocks.org/milroc/d22bbf92231876505e5d) approaches proposed for combining the power of d3 with the flexibility and modularity of ReactJS, the approach I'm using here was inspired by [this blog post](http://10consulting.com/2014/02/19/d3-plus-reactjs-for-charting/) by Ben Smith of [Binary Consulting](http://10consulting.com/).  Basically, it uses React to generate a chart's svg components.

With this approach, ReactJS itself is responsible for the SVG markup.  d3 is used for its tremendous collection of utility functions, such as those that calculate the `path` value for various chart types.

At the moment, everything but the chart axes are generated by React. And pure React chart axes are on the roadmap.

### Roadmap

* v0.3.0:
  * Additional charts types:
    - candlestick
    - table
  * Axes labels
  * Tooltips

* v0.4.0:
  * Additional charts types:
    - slopegraphs
  * Pure React axes

* v0.5.0:
  * Data frame animations

### Changelog

### Project sustainability
Please help to support this project by hiring me for your next contract job.  I do:
* custom d3 and/or React visualizations.
* React, AngularJS, or Backbone frontend work.
* backend work in Python(Flask, Django), Lua(w/Nginx), or Node.js, particularly REST APIs.
